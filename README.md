# 3d-model-handling

Includes various code files to handle files that store 3d model data.
.STL - Stores 3d model as a list of triangles.
.OBJ - Stores 3d models as triangle-vertex lists.

The codes contains files that can parse and convert STL OBJ and other file formats

The code also contains a slicer program to aid in 3d printing.

Files are standalone libraries for the program.

pyslice.py handles the slicing of the model

slicing.py is a standalone code that contains all the independent pieces of code and unifies it as a single program.
